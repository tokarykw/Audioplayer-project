# Title: Visual Audio Project
### Description: Audio Visual UI designed for web
### Created in December 2020 
### Author: Wendy Tokaryk
### For: WDDM-114 Applied Web Design at Humber College

The intention of this assigned project was to build an audio player using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I chose to design a personal and untraditional interface focused on graphic symbolism.  The absence of text references pre-linguistic communication using only hand-drawn or notated elements together with basic sounds.  The sounds reference the human body or tools invented and activated by human touch.

## 1. General Info
What the purpose of the project is? Motivation?
As a student with no prior knowledge of or experience with programming I am interested in the very new and short history of this medium.  From a very recent perspective, I am surprised by the slow rate of innovation and advances in HTML, CSS, and Javascript since the 1990's.  One example is the introduction of the grid and flex box model in CSS onlyhaving occured within the last few years.  The purpose of this project is to engage in practical learning towards understanding these new languages. This is my first attempt at building a model using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to explore both concept and visual design.

## 5. Features
-  I used original icons that I designed and created with Adobe Illustrator.

To-do list:
- Learn more and practice more complex code.
- Modify code to condense it and make it more efficient (use of objects, arrays, and short forms).
- Learn how to add animation and video.  
- Replace illustrations with alternate gif animations then activate upon click, to be played with the existing sounds.
- Progress beyond beginner javascript.
- Create similar, original projects as web documents with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## 6. Status
Project is: in progress.
I will continue to work on this project as a practical learning tool.  Practical application is important to reinforce the new knowledge acquired this term, including the technologies listed in section 4 of this README.md document.
