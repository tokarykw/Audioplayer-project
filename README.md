# Title: Visual Audio Project
### Description: Visual Audio UI designed for web
### Created in December 2020 
### Author: Wendy Tokaryk
### For: WDDM-114 Applied Web Design, and WDDM-115 Tools and Workflow for the Web (Humber College)

The intention of this assigned project was to build an audio player using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I chose to design a personal and untraditional interface (the anti-apple aesthetic) focused on a vernacular-style of graphic symbolism.  The absence of text references logo-syllabic script using only hand-drawn or notated elements together with basic sounds.  The sounds I chose reference the human body or tools and technologies (both old and new) that are activated by human touch.

## 1. General Info
As a student with no prior knowledge of, or experience with, programming I am interested in the very new and short history of this medium.  As a newcomer, I am surprised by the slow rate of innovation and advances in HTML, CSS, and Javascript since the 1990's.  One example is the introduction of the grid and flex box model in CSS (only having occured within the last few years).  The purpose of this Visual Audio Project is to engage in practical learning towards understanding these languages. This is my first attempt at building a model using HTML, CSS, and Javascript that allows me to explore programming together with concept and visual design.

## 5. Features
-  I incorporated original icons that I designed and created with Adobe Illustrator.

To-do list:
- Learn and practice complex javascript.
- Modify javascript to make it more efficient (use of objects, arrays, and short forms).
- Learn how to add animation and video.  
- Replace illustrations with alternate gif animations that activate upon click, to be played in tandem with the existing sounds.
- Progress beyond beginner javascript.
- Create similar, original projects as web documents with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Continue to learn about Github features
- Use Version Control from the beginning of all future projects.

## 6. Status
Project is: in progress.
I will continue to work on this project as a practical learning tool.  Practical application is important to reinforce the new knowledge acquired this term, including the technologies listed in section 4 and the TO-DO list in section 5 of this README.md document. 

## 7. Inspiration
Project inspired by the research of Canadian paleoanthropologist, Genevieve von Petzinger.

I was also inspired by the Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper references throughout the last half of the term.  I pursued independant research about these women to learn more about their contributions to the development of computer programming.  I am intrigued to learn more about women (both past and present) in the fields of computer science, programming, and web development.
