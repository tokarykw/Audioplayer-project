### General info
What the purpose of the project is? Motivation?
As a student with no prior knowledge of or experience with programming I am interested in the very new and short history of this medium.  From a very recent perspective, I am surprised by the slow rate of innovation and advances in HTML, CSS, and Javascript since the 1990's.  One example is the introduction of the grid and flex box model in CSS onlyhaving occured within the last few years.  The purpose of this project is to engage in practical learning towards understanding these new languages. This is my first attempt at building a model using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to explore both concept and visual design.
